# Portfolio Ideas

## Blog

- leftside navbar + profile, right side content
- Profile has image, external social links

## Portfolio

1. large preview area on the right when hovering over a project with thumbnail
2. plain text render in a table with links to the project
3. look up dark mode themes from MUI and follow those

- each project will be a card
  - image of the frontend, if any, generic cool looking code
  - each card will have tags on the technology used
  - clicking on it will bring up a modal that has my role
