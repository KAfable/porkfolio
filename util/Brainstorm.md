# Portfolio Ideas

## Blog

- leftside navbar + profile, right side content
- Profile has image, external social links
- you can query for specific frontmatter
  - so query frontmatter tag that is on the current page

## Portfolio

1. large preview area on the right when hovering over a project with thumbnail
2. plain text render in a table with links to the project
3. look up dark mode themes from MUI and follow those

- each project will be a card
  - image of the frontend, if any, generic cool looking code
  - each card will have tags on the technology used
  - clicking on it will bring up a modal that has my role


### Blog Nav

- GitHub
- Linkedin
- YouTube
- Twitter?

## Color Theme

- #36393f background priamry
- always have a label if you use icons

## Schema Notes

- plugsins prefixed by `Gatsby-Source` let you source data from various resources

### Blog Post

1. data
2. content (in markdown)
3. title

- do I want a sub-header or subtitle?
- What about any images itself?
